    <p>What more can we say? A classic roast chicken recipe should be in everyone's repertoire, and it can always save the day</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>2 carrots, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 free range chicken, about 1.5kg/3lb 5oz</li>
            <li>1 lemon, halved</li>
            <li>small bunch thyme (optional)</li>
            <li>25g butter, softened</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Have a shelf ready in the middle of the oven without any shelves above it.</li>
            <li>Scatter 1 roughly chopped onion and 2 roughly chopped carrots over the base of a roasting tin that fits the whole 1 ½ kg chicken, but doesn’t swamp it.</li>
            <li>Season the cavity of the chicken liberally with salt and pepper, then stuff with 2 lemon halves and a small bunch of thyme, if using.</li>
            <li>Sit the chicken on the vegetables, smother the breast and legs all over with 25g softened butter, then season the outside with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place in the oven and leave, undisturbed, for 1 hr 20 mins – this will give you a perfectly roasted chicken. To check, pierce the thigh with a skewer and the juices should run clear.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the tin from the oven and, using a pair of tongs, lift the chicken to a dish or board to rest for 15-20 mins. As you lift the dish, let any juices from the chicken pour out of the cavity into the roasting tin.</li>
        </ol>
